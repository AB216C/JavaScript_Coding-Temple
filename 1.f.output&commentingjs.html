  <!-- Why Use Output Methods?
  Debugging: They help you understand what's happening in your code by allowing you to inspect variables and program flow.
  User Interaction: Output methods enable you to communicate with users, providing feedback and information.
  Data Display: They allow you to show results of calculations or user inputs dynamically, making applications interactive and engaging. 
  1. using console.log() it logs a message to the console
  2. alert()
  3. document.write(): This method writes content directly to the HTML document. It's not commonly used in modern web development because it can overwrite existing content if called after the document is fully loaded.
