Which Node.js Version Should You Install?
When downloading Node.js, there are two primary versions available:

LTS (Long-Term Support) Version
Stable and ideal for projects that need long-term reliability.
Recommended for most tutorials and production environments where consistency and stability are key.
Security updates and bug fixes are prioritized.

Current Version
Includes the latest features and enhancements.
